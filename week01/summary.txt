Data science is a science whose subject of interest is learning from data or data analysis. 
It is a field to improve something in evidence-based manner. 
It is an interdisciplinary which combines statistics, programming, visualization, data analysis and big data.
Data Science is also not just about dealing with enormous volumes of data. 
According to Data Science Initiative at the University of Michigan, Data Science is a combination of scientific discovery 
and practices that involves processes like collection of data, management, processing, analysis, visualization and 
interpretation of huge amounts of data associated with a diverse array of applications such as scientific, translational, etc.
Though most data science terms match with roles of the applied statistician, data science is more much than that.
Statistics are a part of what goes on in data science, but not a huge part. 
The term statistics means the practice of collecting and analyzing numerical data in large quantities. 
Data scientist is a professional who uses scientific methods to create meaningful insights from the data. 
Also, a data scientist needs have knowledge in applied machine learning and a professional who is working in applied statistics might not even know that term. 
Though most of the terms in data science might seem familiar to professionals working in statistics, that knowledge alone wouldnâ€™t be sufficient to land in a job in data science field.
Data science is an intersection of Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, Programming, applied statistics and domain knowledge.
